On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 4.75 based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile

2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors

3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:


4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines (e.g. it contains extraneous code from the example program that has not been removed) or is insufficiently documented.
Verify that it:
[X] Gets all the input from the user before connecting to the server.
[ ] Includes the required headers in the DATA portion.
[X] Displays all the commands sent to the server and all the responses from the server
[X] Handles messages with multiple lines in an appropriate way.

5  The program produces correct output and is well written and complies with all the Chapman Computer Science Coding Standards

Suggestions for improving the code:
Just needed the required headers in the DATA portion (From: To: not printed in DATA portion)

Stay consistent with how you display the commands to server and responses to server,
was just a bit confusing to recognize whether some lines were a command or a response.
